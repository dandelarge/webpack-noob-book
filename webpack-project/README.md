# WEBPACK project

## The mission
Let's make a react app from scratch

## What does the app do?
It prints cowsay
https://github.com/piuccio/cowsay

when you go to / the cow should print in the screen saying hello world
There must be an input, The input changes what the cow says

## Rules
- We are building the thing from scratch
- No SSR <Server Side Rendering> (for now)
- The cow will be printed using react (somehow)
- we want a build process that does 
    - transpiling
    - bundling
    - minification
    - filename hashing
- after that, we need a dev-env

# Chapter 8: Other techniques related to the Build step

## What's the point?
There are a bunch of techniques and optimizations happening in the frontend.

we've got Minimization, concatenation, hashing, transpilation, obfuscation, and more...

## Take aways
- CDN Optimization is a server / architecture solution, we address the frontend part with hashing
- Minimization and obfuscation often go together
- we did not talk about transpilation yet
